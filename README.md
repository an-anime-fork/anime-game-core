# ü¶Ä Anime Game Core

Unified library to control different games installations. Provides basic instruments for adding support for mechanics like game updating 

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Current implementation is considered legacy. No deep changes will be made in 1.* branch.
> The universal launcher project now uses 2.* branch, but all the functions there could be implemented within the app itself instead of having a separate library.
